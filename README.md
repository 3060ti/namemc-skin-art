## NameMC Skin Art

Ill make this look better later but:

# Usage
Put your image in the directory as `input.jpg`, run `main.py` and paste in your bearer token. It will generate the image files, and start sending requests to mojang. You must update the NameMc profile by reloading every time it tells you to. It will delete all the temp files at end

# Issues / TODO
Identical Skins will mess it up by not creating a slot in the namemc profile.
it also messes up with certain sizes but whatever

# Extra thingies
If u want to change the template skin, update the box coordinates in line 8 of `main.py`

If you have any issues, DM me on discord at: `chromiumsucks#4268`
